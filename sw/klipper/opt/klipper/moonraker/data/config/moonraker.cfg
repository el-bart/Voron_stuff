[file_manager]
# By default Moonraker will validate that Klipper's configuration file exists
# within the data path's "config" folder, as this is a requirement for
# Moonraker to write to the configuration.  If this validation check fails
# Moonraker will warn the user. Installations that do not wish to use Moonraker
# to manage Klipper's configuration may set this option to False to bypass the
# location check.  The default is True.
check_klipper_config_path: False
# When enabled the configuration folder is writable over the API.  Some
# installations, such as those in public areas, may wish to lock out
# configuration changes.  The default is True.
enable_config_write_access: False

[machine]
# The provider implementation used to collect system service information
# and run service actions (ie: start, restart, stop).  This can be "none",
# "supervisord_cli", "systemd_dbus", or "systemd_cli".  If the provider is
# set to "none" service action APIs will be disabled.
# The default is systemd_dbus.
provider: none
# Enables validation of Moonraker's systemd service unit.  If Moonraker
# detects that a change is necessary it will attempt to do so.  Custom
# installations and installations that do systemd should set this to False.
# The default is True.
validate_service: False

[webcam corner_cam]
# An optional boolean value to indicate if this webcam should be enabled.
# Default is True.
enabled: False
# A description of the webcam location, ie: what the webcam is observing.
# The default is "printer".
location: printer
# A name of the icon to use for the camera.  See the tip following this
# example for known values.  The default is mdiWebcam.
icon:
# The name of the application or service hosting the webcam stream.  Front-
# ends may use this configuration to determine how to connect to the service
# and interpret its stream.  See the tip following this example for
# currently known values.  The default is "mjpegstreamer".
service: mjpegstreamer
# An integer value specifying the target framerate.  The default is 15 fps.
target_fps: 15
# An integer value specifying the target framerate when the printer is idle.
# The default is 5 fps.
target_fps_idle: 5
# The url for the camera stream request.  This may be a full url or a
# relative path (ie: /webcam?action=stream) if the stream is served on the
# same host as Moonraker at port 80.  This parameter must be provided.
stream_url:
# The url for the camera snapshot request.  This may be a full url or a
# relative path (ie: /webcam?action=stream) if the stream is served on the
# same host as Moonraker at port 80.  The default is an empty url.
snapshot_url:
# A boolean value indicating whether the stream should be flipped
# horizontally.  The default is false.
flip_horizontal: False
# A boolean value indicating whether the stream should be flipped
# vertically.  The default is false.
flip_vertical: False
# An integer value indicating the amount of clockwise rotation to apply
# to the stream.  May be 0, 90, 180, or 270.  The default is 0.
rotation: 0
# The aspect ratio to display for the camera.  Note that this option
# is specific to certain services, otherwise it is ignored.
# The default is 4:3.
aspect_ratio: 4:3

[history]

#[update_manager]
# A boolean value that can be used to toggle system package updates.
# Currently Moonraker only supports updating packages via APT, so
# this option is useful for users that wish to experiment with linux
# distros that use other package management applications, or users
# that prefer to manage their packages directly.  Note that if this
# is set to False users will be need to make sure that all system
# dependencies are up to date.  The default is True.
#enable_system_updates: False
